# pythonProject
**A one-paragraph or longer description of what your project is about. Do not skip this.**
Import a CSV containing raw warehouse productivity data and modify it to match the required schema of the BigQuery table it will be uploaded to
- Create an anonymized and randomized the CSV source file
- Import the source CSV of warehouse productivity data in a Pandas Dataframe. 
- Remove unneeded fields
- Add fields that are not in the raw CSV but needed for the BigQuery table it will be uploaded to
- Change fields to the correct data types to match the BigQuery schema
- Analyze data
- Add data visualizations
- Export data to a CSV that can be uploaded to the BigQuery table

**Relevant packages that need to be installed to run the project. This can be a requirements.txt, a config.py file, or just commands formatted neatly in markdown on your readme that say “pip install pandas” for example. But you have to specify which packages need to be installed. **

**Which 3+ features you have included from the below lists to meet the requirements**
- Read in data from a local csv, excel file, json, or any other file type. There are many ways to do this, but using Pandas read_ functions is pretty easy.
- Use custom functions or lambdas to perform specific operations to clean or manipulate your data, return those values, then use them in other parts of your project.
- Use at least 5 different built-in Python functions to find out something about your data. If you had a list for example, finding the length of that list with len(<list>) does tell us a little bit about the data. 
- Make 2 basic plots with matplotlib, seaborn, or any other kind of visualization library that you think looks interesting
  
**Any special instructions are required for the reviewer to run your project. (For example: “run python main.py” from the command line)**
  
**Guide to using markdown for README.md files (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)**
  
**Describe the data used in the analysis in the README file.**
